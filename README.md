 📊 Machine Learning – Task 2: Customer Segmentation using K-means  In this task, I implemented **K-means clustering** to group customers of a retail store based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**
 
### 🔍 Steps Performed:
- ✅ Loaded the dataset and explored the data  
- ✅ Used the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters (found **5 clusters**)  
- ✅ Applied **K-means clustering** to segment customers into groups  
- ✅ Visualized the clusters with a scatter plot  

### 📈 Outputs:
- **Elbow Method Plot** (Shows optimal number of clusters)

- **Customer Segments Plot** (Shows customers grouped into 5 clusters)
